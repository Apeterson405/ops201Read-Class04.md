1. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?

   By using command "dir".

2. How might the "sfc" command and the "gpupdate" command, help in troubleshooting on Windows?

   The "sfc" command allows you to scan all the core operating system files. The "gpupdate" command allows you to force a particular set of updates.

3. What advantages does the "robocopy" command offer over the "xcopy" command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?

   It has the ability to resume a file transfer if it happens to be interrupted anywhere in the middle. This can be especially good for wide area network or non-terrestrial links, where you may have intermittent connectivity.

4. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line toll would help address the situation.

   A lot of times, I have to explain to customers, why their equipment return is being denied. We have a tool that has the pictures of the damage on denied equipment returns. However, the files are not in proper order. Simply using the command "dir" I can see the list of those files.
